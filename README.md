# Typed Lambda Calculus Interpreter

This project implements a simple interpreter for the simply typed lambda calculus, inspired by the work of Andrew Appel and David Walker. The interpreter supports basic types, function abstraction, and application, demonstrating core concepts in programming language semantics and type systems.

## Features
- Type checking for lambda expressions
- Evaluation of lambda terms
- Example programs and usage

## Academic Relevance
The simply typed lambda calculus is foundational in programming language theory, forming the basis for type systems in functional languages. This project helps understand type safety, substitution, and evaluation semantics as discussed in Appel's and Walker's research and textbooks.
